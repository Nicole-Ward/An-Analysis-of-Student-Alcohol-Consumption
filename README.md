# An-Analysis-of-Student-Alcohol-Consumption
With the prevalence of partying and Greek life across high schools and colleges, student alcohol consumption is not only extremely prevalent, but accepted, on campuses. Thus, we seek to analyze the relationships between student alcohol consumption and variables relating to home life, social life, and personal background. We used a dataset created from a survey of students in secondary school with 30 variables relating to familial factors, school-related data, and demographic data. Our goal is to find a model that demonstrates how significant predictors correlate with alcohol consumption. 
	
Some questions we had when first looking at this dataset were: does student alcohol consumption differ between male and female students? We also wanted to explore how other family related factors, including family size, parents’ cohabitation status, and family relationship quality may correlate with alcohol consumption in students. We were also curious as to how parents’ level of education and job related to student alcohol consumption as well. Finally, we want to explore how variables relating to students' social lives, such as going out and absences from school, relate to student alcohol consumption.
